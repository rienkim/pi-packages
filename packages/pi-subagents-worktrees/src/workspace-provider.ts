/**
 * workspace-provider.ts — git worktree implementation of the pi-subagents
 * WorkspaceProvider seam (ADR 0002, Phase 16 Step 3).
 *
 * The core consults a registered provider for every child run. This provider
 * isolates a child in a git worktree only when its agent type is opted in via
 * `worktreeAgents`; for any other agent it returns `undefined`, leaving the
 * child to run in the parent cwd. On worktree-creation failure for an opted-in
 * agent it throws, failing the run loudly rather than silently running
 * unisolated (preserving the core's former strict behavior).
 *
 * @gotgenes/pi-subagents@11.6.0 exports only `WorkspaceProvider` by name; its
 * collaborator types (the prepare context, the prepared workspace) are reachable
 * only through it, so we recover them with indexed-access aliases rather than
 * named imports. Once #272 ships named re-exports, replace the aliases below
 * with direct imports and bump the dependency.
