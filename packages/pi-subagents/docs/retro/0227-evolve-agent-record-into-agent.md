# Retro: #227 — Evolve AgentRecord into Agent with behavior

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-27T12:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced an 8-step TDD plan to move per-agent behavior (`abort`, `queueSteer`/`flushPendingSteers`, `setupWorktree`) from `AgentManager` into `AgentRecord`, then rename `AgentRecord` → `Agent` across the codebase.
The plan follows a "add behavior first, rename last" strategy to keep behavior diffs small and the rename commit purely mechanical.

### Observations

- `AgentRecord` is internal-only (public API is `SubagentRecord` in `service.ts`), so the rename is non-breaking.
- The `queueSteer` method can be removed from `AgentManagerLike` and `SteerToolManager` interfaces entirely — both callers (`steer-tool`, `service-adapter`) already hold the agent reference from `getRecord()`, so they can call `agent.queueSteer()` directly.
- Queue removal in `abort()` must stay on `AgentManager` until #230 extracts `ConcurrencyQueue`.
- `RunHandle` ownership explicitly deferred to #228 — the plan does not touch `RunHandle` at all.
- The rename step (step 7) touches ~30 files but is purely mechanical; all behavior changes land in steps 1–6.
