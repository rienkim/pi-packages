# Testing

Load this skill when writing, debugging, or planning tests.

## Vitest mock patterns

- When using `vi.mock()`, extract each `vi.fn()` stub to a module-scope variable and reset it in `beforeEach` — `vi.restoreAllMocks()` only operates on `vi.spyOn()` spies, not on `vi.fn()` instances.
  Use `.mockReset()` when the stub has no default implementation.
  Use `.mockClear()` when the `vi.mock()` factory provides a default implementation that tests must preserve.
- When a `vi.mock()` factory references a module-scope `vi.fn()` stub, wrap the stub declaration in `vi.hoisted()` — Vitest hoists `vi.mock()` above normal declarations, so unhoisted variables are `undefined` when the factory runs.
- When a `vi.fn()` factory returns an empty array or narrow literal, annotate its return type explicitly — `vi.fn((): string[] => [])`, not `vi.fn(() => [])`.
  Without the annotation TypeScript infers `never[]`, and subsequent `mockReturnValueOnce([...])` calls fail with “not assignable to `never`”.
  Use `import type` to pull domain types (e.g., `AgentConfig`, `PreloadedSkill`) for the annotation.
- When typing a mock field on an interface, use `Mock<specific-signature>` — e.g., `Mock<() => void>`, `Mock<(arg: string) => Promise<void>>`.
  Do not use `ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>` — in Vitest v4 it expands to `Mock<Procedure | Constructable>`, a union that TypeScript cannot call.
- When mocking a class constructor with `vi.mock()`, use `vi.fn()` with no implementation — not `vi.fn(() => ({}))`.
  Arrow-function implementations are not constructable; `new MockClass()` throws `"is not a constructor"`.
- When mocking `node:*` built-in modules with `vi.mock()`, include a `default` key mirroring the named exports — omitting it causes "No default export defined on the mock" errors.
- When testing code that uses `setInterval`, never use `vi.runAllTimersAsync()` — it loops infinitely.
  Use `vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(ms)` with a specific duration instead.
- Prefer reading `process.env` inside functions rather than capturing it as a module-level constant — `vi.stubEnv()` alone cannot change a constant already evaluated at import time.
  If a module-level constant is unavoidable, test it with `vi.resetModules()` + `await import(...)` inside the test body, and call `vi.unstubAllEnvs()` + `vi.resetModules()` in `afterEach`.

## Test assertions

- Prefer strong assertions that match the **entire** expected value (`toBe`, `toEqual`) over subset matchers (`toContain`, `toMatchObject`, `expect.objectContaining`).
  Weak assertions hide unexpected values and make tests less useful as documentation.
  When a weak assertion is necessary (third-party output, non-deterministic ordering), add a comment explaining why.
- Prefer a concrete test asserting current (even imperfect) behavior over `test.todo`.
  A real assertion documents the limitation and lets a future fix flip the expectation.
- When a test reveals a pre-existing bug rather than a wrong assumption, use `test.fails` to document the expected behavior and file a GitHub issue.
- Do not insert no-op statements (`void 0;`, unused locals) in tests just to make an `Edit` tool's `oldText` unique — widen `oldText` with surrounding context instead.

## Type checking

Vitest uses esbuild and does not typecheck.
Run `pnpm run check` (`tsc --noEmit`) for type-only changes.

## Running tests

- Run a single file: `pnpm vitest run <test-path>`
- Run the full suite: `pnpm vitest run`
- When a fix changes shared helper functions, run the full suite before committing — not just the directly affected test file.

## TDD planning rules

- When a TDD step changes behavior, account for existing tests that will break.
  Either fold the test updates into the same step or place a dedicated test-update step immediately before it.
- When a TDD plan lists separate steps that share a type definition, changing that type in step N breaks steps N+1…N+k.
  Either fold them into one step or introduce the new type alongside the old one and migrate callers incrementally.
- When a plan adds a parameter that flows through callback chains, the "Module-Level Changes" section must list every file in the chain.
- When a TDD step changes a shared interface, run `pnpm run check` immediately after that step's commit.
- When a TDD step changes an interface that has a single call site (e.g., a deps bag constructed in `index.ts`), the step must include updating that call site — the type checker will not allow the interface change and the call-site update to land in separate commits.
- When adding a field to a shared interface, grep for ALL test files that construct a compatible mock — not just factory helpers.
- When removing fields from a shared init type, grep for all test files and factory helpers that pass the removed field — esbuild won't reject unknown properties at runtime, so tests silently get wrong default values instead of failing.
- When a TDD plan converts an interface to a class, grep for `{ ...variable` spread patterns in tests — spreading a class instance produces a plain object that lacks the class's methods and private fields.
  Replace with `createTestX({ ...overrides })` factory calls or direct field mutation.
- When integrating an unfamiliar library or data structure, write a disposable exploratory script first to inspect the actual runtime shape.
- When consolidating duplicate test factories into a shared helper, diff the default values across all copies before writing the shared factory.
  Different defaults cause cascading assertion failures during migration steps.
