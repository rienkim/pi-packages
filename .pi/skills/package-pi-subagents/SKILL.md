# pi-subagents

Pi extension that adds Claude Code-style autonomous subagent dispatch to the Pi coding agent.

This package is a **hard fork** of [`tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents).
The fork diverges intentionally from upstream with material scope reduction and a typed API boundary.
See `docs/architecture/architecture.md` for the full decomposition plan and `docs/decisions/0001-deferred-patches.md` (superseded) for the original thin-patch rationale.

The fork carries three original patches from the thin-patch era, still present in the codebase:

1. **Peer-dep rename** — peer dependencies point at `@earendil-works/pi-*` (the active scope) rather than the deprecated `@mariozechner/pi-*` scope.
2. **Patch 2 (post-bind active-tool re-filter)** — `runAgent` re-runs the active-tool filter after `session.bindExtensions(...)` so extension-registered tools land in the child's active tool set.
3. **Patch 3 (active_agent tag)** — `runAgent` prepends `<active_agent name="${agentConfig.name}"/>` to every assembled child system prompt so `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` can resolve per-agent `permission:` frontmatter inside the child.

Upstream PRs for these patches ([#71](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/71), [#72](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/72), [#73](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/73)) are open but the fork continues independently regardless.

## Implementation Priorities

- Follow the phased plan in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
- Narrow core — the extension owns agent spawning, execution, and result retrieval; everything else is a consumer.
- Typed API boundary — export `SubagentsService` via `Symbol.for()` accessors so other extensions can spawn agents without importing this package directly (done, #48).
- Remove scheduling subsystem (done); ad-hoc RPC and group-join (done); output-file porting to Pi session format tracked in #61.
- Cherry-pick upstream fixes when they align with this fork's scope; do not track upstream as a merge target.

## Code Style

Formatting is handled by Biome (`biome check`, `biome format`).
The repo intentionally does not use Prettier — a top-level `.prettierignore` blocks any harness with project-level write-time Prettier formatting from reformatting files here.

## Testing

The fork preserves upstream's full `vitest` suite (362 tests) plus tests added for Patches 2 and 3.
All tests must pass before publishing.
Use `vi.hoisted(...)` for module-level mocks, matching the existing patterns in `test/agent-runner.test.ts`.

## Notes for Agents

When working in this package:

1. The two RepOne-specific patches are marked in source — search for `// Patch 2 (RepOne` or `// Patch 3 (RepOne` to find them.
2. New features and removals follow the phase plan in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
   Document architectural decisions in `docs/decisions/`.
3. The upstream test suite is run periodically as a regression canary for the `agent-runner` core.
4. Modules marked `← removing` or `← replacing` in the architecture doc's current-state listing are slated for deletion — do not add features to them.

## Architecture

See `docs/architecture/architecture.md` for the full architecture document with Mermaid diagrams, domain model, structural analysis, and improvement roadmap.
Refactoring history is preserved in `docs/architecture/history/` (one file per completed phase).

### Domain organization

The extension is organized into six domains (53 files, 7,288 LOC):

| Domain      | Directory                                                                                                                                            | Modules | Responsibility                                                                             |

Entry point (`index.ts`), runtime (`runtime.ts`), shared types (`types.ts`), settings (`settings.ts`), debug (`debug.ts`), and event handlers (`handlers/`) sit at the root.
